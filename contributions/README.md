### Individual Contribution to Group Project: Analyzing High-End Airbnb Customer Preferences

#### As a key member of our analytics team, I played a crucial role in shaping our project on high-spending Airbnb customers' preferences. During our brainstorming session on May 26th, we defined our main business question: “What are customers booking the top range of Airbnb reservations looking for?” Each member contributed ideas, fostering a collaborative environment. We also formulated follow-up questions on top booking areas, geographic patterns, and amenities influencing preferences. My facilitation of open discussions and encouragement of diverse perspectives were pivotal in ensuring well-rounded team decisions.

#### Fig 1 shows our May 31st meeting meeting notes, I focused on K-means clustering for profiling high-spending Airbnb customers during our exploratory data analyses (EDA). Analyzing the top 25% of spenders in Manhattan and Brooklyn, I cleaned the data and used the elbow method to identify four distinct customer segments. Cluster 2, the highest spenders, preferred entire homes or apartments in Manhattan for extended stays, indicating a demand for space and luxury. These insights were critical for shaping our marketing strategies to effectively target premium customers.

#### Throughout the project, I contributed beyond data analysis by participating in discussions to outline next steps and keep the project organized. In the final meeting, I completed the code and documented my section in the appendix. My clustering methodology and marketing strategies were key components of our final report. Our teamwork and adherence to deadlines led to a comprehensive report, and our collective agreement on the final version highlighted the effectiveness of our collaboration and analysis.

### Evaluation of Neural Network Model for Object Recognition: Technical Insights and Presentation Experience

#### Creating and delivering the presentation on the Neural Network Model for Object Recognition was a valuable learning experience. I gained a deep understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. This included data preprocessing techniques like normalization and one-hot encoding, the importance of validation sets, and training the model while preventing overfitting. I became proficient in implementing CNN components such as convolutional layers, max pooling layers, dropout layers, and activation functions like ReLU and softmax. This practical application solidified my knowledge and highlighted the significance of each component in achieving a high-performing model (Brownlee, 2022).

<p>Fig2: Training and Validation Accuracy and Loss</p>


#### Figure 2 shows the training and validation accuracy and loss over 25 epochs. The training accuracy steadily increases, while the validation accuracy stabilizes, indicating potential overfitting after a certain point. The validation loss begins to increase after 10 epochs, highlighting diminishing returns on generalization performance. This experience taught me the importance of monitoring both training and validation metrics to detect overfitting and adjust the training process for better generalization (Lehn, 2023).

#### This experience enhanced my ability to communicate complex technical ideas using visual aids. Creating the PowerPoint required careful planning to ensure each slide conveyed key points succinctly. Visual elements like pie charts, line graphs, diagrams, bar charts, and heatmaps effectively illustrated concepts and model performance. For example, Figure 3 shows feature maps from the first convolutional layer, highlighting how different filters capture various features. Recording the presentation improved my public speaking skills, helping me articulate thoughts clearly and maintain a steady pace. This experience underscored the importance of combining technical proficiency with effective communication.
